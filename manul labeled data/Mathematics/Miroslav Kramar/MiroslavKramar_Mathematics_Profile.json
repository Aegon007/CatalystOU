    "Comparative Analysis: Examines different approaches, measures, and system behaviors against each other to obtain deeper insights (e.g., compared various CNN models for force reconstruction).",
    "Data-Driven Analysis: Uses data (simulated, empirical, synthetic) as the primary basis of understanding and modeling the phenomena (e.g., force networks from experimental photo elastic images).",
    "Modular Approach: Breaks down the problem into smaller and manageable sub-problems which are then addressed individually (e.g., force reconstruction was split into inferring its different properties individually)."
